## Features

- **Progressive enhancement** — full server-side state management and, works
  without JavaScript
- **Touch & keyboard** — swipe on mobile, arrow-keys or `u`/`r`/`h` shortcuts on
  desktop
- **CSS-only replays** — animated solution playback, no JS animation libraries
- **Smart solver** — BFS-based solver finds optimal solutions and powers the
  hint system
- **Dark/light theme** — follows system preference
- **Puzzle editor** — create, generate, and share your own puzzles with a
  live-solving difficulty badge
- **Leaderboards** — compare your solution against others

## Editor

<!-- TODO: add video -->

The built-in editor lets you create puzzles from scratch or generate random
solvable boards with configurable difficulty. A debounced solver runs on every
edit, showing the optimal solution length in real time.

## Getting Started

Requires [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation).

```bash
# Start dev server with file watching
deno task dev

# Build for production
deno task build

# Preview production build
deno task preview
```

## Project Structure

```
routes/          File-system routes (pages + API)
islands/         Interactive Preact components (hydrated client-side)
components/      Static server-rendered components
lib/             Client-side logic (touch, keyboard, replay, routing)
util/            Core game logic (board, solver, parser, moves)
db/              Deno KV database layer
static/puzzles/  Puzzle definitions in Markdown + ASCII
```

## Puzzle Format

Puzzles are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter and an ASCII board:

```markdown
---
name: My Puzzle
slug: my-puzzle
createdAt: 2025-06-15T00:00:00.000Z
---

+ A B C D E F G H +
1 #     #         |
2   X             |
3    |            |
4                 |
5                 |
6         @       |
7                 |
8 #               |
+-----------------+
```

Walls are placed with `|` (vertical) and `_` (horizontal). (see parser.ts for
custom edge case characters if needed) Save it as an `.md` file in
`static/puzzles/` and it auto-registers via a custom Vite plugin.
